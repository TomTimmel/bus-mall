** Bus-Mall Plan for coding strategy

** As a developer, I want to create a web page will give the Bus Mall the information on which products to carry in their new catalog. Users will be able to select products they are interested in by clicking on a series of images. The web site will specifically do the following for the Bus Mall company:

- A list of three randomly generated images will show up on the screen at a time.  The user will be directed to select the product that they are most interested in.
- Each new set of images will be different than the last three, after one interation, the images will be allowed to reused and re-clicked.
- The user will select 25 images. Once 25 images have been selected, the data of their selections will show up in a chart for analysis.

** Development Plan:

-Load the product photos, and get them to randomly display in groups of three.
-Provide the functionality so that images don't repeat in the next set after each click.
-Provide functionality so that each view and click are captured for analysis.
-Build chart using Chart.js to illustrate the captured views and clicks.
